                <h2>Wine Tasting in France</h2>
                <p>I had an amazing time touring the vineyards and wineries of France! As a wine lover, it was a dream to visit some of the world's most renowned wine regions.</p>
                <br>

                <p>In Bordeaux, I sampled incredibleCabernets and Merlots while soaking in the charming chateaux and medieval villages along the river. In Burgundy, I biked around quaint towns and tasted dazzling Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays. My favourite was Champagne, where touring the underground cellars and sipping bubbly was the perfect end to my wine adventures.</p>

                <h2>My adventure in Japan</h2>
                <p>For our first full day in Tokyo, we visited the Meiji Shrine, the Imperial Palace, the Harajuku District/Takeshita street, and the Sensoji Temple in Shibuya. The Meiji Shrine was the perfect way to start off the trip. It had beautiful greenery, wasn’t too loud, was close to the city, and introduced traditional Japanese culture right off the bat. While we were there, we were lucky enough to see a traditional Shinto wedding ceremony! I had never seen anything like it. It was very interesting to see that ancient traditions are still taking place in our very technologically advanced modern world. That might have been the most fascinating part of the trip: how Japan preserves its ancient history while continuing to modernize at the same time.</p>

                    <li>Todaiji temple housed a massive Buddha statue that was accompanied by two smaller, golden statues and two stone statues of Hindu gods. </li>
                    <li>Osaka is known as the food capital of Japan, which got everyone very excited to explore the street food and vendors at Dotonbori.</li>
                    <li>Lastly visiting the Hiroshima Bombing Memorial and Peace Park</li>
